          <p>
            The Cancer Proteogenomic Data Analysis Site (cProSite) is a
            web-based interactive platform that provides on-line proteomic and
            phosphoproteomic analysis for the data of the{" "}

              Consortium
            </a>{" "}
            (CPTAC). The platform has advantages compared to regular analytical
            methods:
            <ul style={{ listStyle: "none" }}>
              <li>1) Faster on-line analysis.</li>
              <li>2) More user-friendly environment.</li>
              <li>
                3) Less need for bioinformatics expertise to perform the
                analysis. cProSite currently includes 10 tumor types (breast
                cancer, colon cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, lung
                adenocarcinoma (Lung AD), lung squamous carcinoma (Lung SC),
                ovarian cancer, stomach cancer and uterine cancer). The cProSite
                Dataset will be updated with the new CPTAC release.

            Features of cProSite include:
            <ul style={{ listStyle: "none" }}>
              <li>
                1) Comparing selected protein abundance between tumors and
                normal adjacent tissues and show protein abundance fold-changes
                between paired tumor and control cases.
              </li>
              <li>
                2) Comparing selected levels of individual phosphorylation sites
                or levels of phosphorylation site per protein abundance and show
                fold-changes between tumors and normal adjacent tissues.
              </li>
              <li>
                3) Correlating protein abundance, phosphorylation site levels,
                or phosphorylation site level per protein abundance between two
                selected proteins.
              </li>
              <li>
                4) Correlating selected protein abundance with its mRNA
                expression level if the data are available. cProSite allows
                users to download the analyzed data through its export feature.

            . Because of the limitations of mass spectrometry and the analytic
            algorithms, not all proteins and all phosphorylation sites are
            detected for individual samples.
